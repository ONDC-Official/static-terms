PURPOSE OF THIS DOCUMENT
V1.2 of the ONDC API Specification is going to allow Network Participants (NPs) to add some of their own standard contractual terms to the digital Transaction Level Contract. These standard terms (hereafter referred to as “static terms”) will be inserted into the digital contract as a URL which will be mapped to the “static_terms” attribute in the API Specification. These are boilerplate contractual terms which do not change from one transaction to another (hence the name static terms) - such as indemnity, force majeure etc. The static terms hosted on the URL specified by the NP, along with the payload of the APIs will form the contract between the Buyer App and Seller App for a given transaction.
